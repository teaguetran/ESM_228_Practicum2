## Release

## Measurement Goal & Measure

**Goal**: Assess the level of knowledge about safe release techniques over time.

"In general, how likely will a manta ray survive if it is lifted by a brailer or piece of canvas and returned to the sea?"

a. Very Likely
b. Somewhat Likely
c. Somewhat Unlikely
d. Very Unlikely
e. Don't Know


## Source & Rationale & Unit

*Source*: Indepedent survey firm sampling from landing sites at regular intervals.

*Rationale*: The best way to test knowledge is to measure it directly. The answer to the question is not obvious and it does not lead the respondent in a particular direction.

*Unit*: individual survey respondent


## Responsibility & Frequency

*Responsibility*: Manta Trust will directly hire survey firm, but will coordinate with the PFDA to expand the monitoring in the future.

*Frequency*: The intention is to track changes in attitudes over time. Annual surveys will allow tracking and matches the time period over which it is feasible for attitudes to change.


## Declaring the population

Using administrative data, I found the approximate number of vessel visits per month that land tuna.

Landing site       Approximate vessels per month
-----------        -----------------------------
General Santos      700
Navotas             670
Iloilo              150
Lucena              140
Zamboanga           40
Davao               30
Sual                8


## Target Population & Challenges

*Target Population*: fishing vessel captains who use purse seine techniques

*Challenge of drawing a representative sample*: sampling effort must be done in landing site clusters, but clusters are of unequal size. It is unclear how often captains return to the same port over the course of the year.

*Sampling procedure*: Cluster-based sampling at ports with unequal effort according to potential sample size.

## DeclareDesign()

```{r pop}
set.seed(228)
population <- declare_population(
  port = add_level(N=7,
         baseline=c(0.6,0.6,0.4,0.4,0.1,0.1,0.1)),
  captain = add_level(N=c(700,670,150,140,40,30,8),
                      know=draw_binary(baseline))
)
pop <- population()
pop.vector <- c(700,670,150,140,40,30,8)

my_estimand <- declare_estimands(mean(know),
                                 label = "Ybar")
#PH: ok, similar to the examples in previous lectures, we're using the declare_population () function to create our population of fishing vessel captains who use purse seine techniques. We're saying that there are 1738 captains in total over the 7 different ports in our population. The 'baseline' variable represents the proportion of captains at each particular we think use purse seine techniques. We use these probability to calculate our outcome, the 'know' variable, which is binary variable (0/1). We then declare out population. Out estimand is the mean level of knowledge among the sample.

```

## DeclareDesign()

```{r report-samp}
reporting <- declare_assignment(prob=0.8,
                  assignment_variable = "R")
#PH: declaring the assignment (or in this case, sampling) process.

sampling <- declare_sampling(strata=port,
               strata_n=c(80,80,80,80,8,8,8))
#PH: saying that we want to sample by port, our strata. We're going to take 80 units from the first, second, third, and fourth ports, and then 8 units from the remaining ports.
```

## DeclareDesign()

```{r declare-estimator}

strata_weighted_mean <- function(data){
  data.frame(  
  estimator_label = "strata_w_mean",
  estimand_label = "Ybar",
  n = nrow(data),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
  
  estimate = data %>% filter(R==1) %>% #PH: subset out units that are not sampled.
    group_by(port) %>% 
    summarise(mean=mean(know)) %>%
    mutate(prop=pop.vector/sum(pop.vector)) %>% #PH: 'prop' is a variable calculating the proportion of units in the population that are at a given port.
    mutate(sub.mean=mean*prop) %>% pull(sub.mean) %>%  #PH: 'sub.mean' is a weighted average of the knowledge level within a given port.
    sum()) #PH: sums all the weighed averages of knowledge within ports to get a weighted sample mean.
} #just use this function, custom

#PH: here, we're declaring a second estimator that will estimate the population mean by calculating a strata weighted mean of the sample

```

## DeclareDesign()

```{r diagnosis, cache=TRUE}

answer <- declare_estimator(
  handler = tidy_estimator(strata_weighted_mean), #PH: this is the custom function we wrote in the chunk above.
  estimand = my_estimand) #PH: 'my_estimand' is the true population mean of knowledge. We happen to know this in this case (b/c we faked the data), but you'll have to make an educated guess about what this is in practice. Often, you see people designing M&E programs cite research to take a stab at the actual value of the estimand.

design <- population + my_estimand + reporting +
          sampling + answer
diagnosis <- diagnose_design(design, sims = 1000)

diagnosis$diagnosands_df[,c(4,5,12,14)] %>%
  kable()
